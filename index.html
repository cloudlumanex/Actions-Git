      <h1>Emmanuel (sky) DevOps Engineer</h1>
      <h2>My First Web App Deployed with GitHub Actions CI/CD</h2>
      <p>
        Today marks a major milestone in my DevOps journey. I successfully deployed this web
        application using a fully automated GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
      </p>

      <p>
        From source code commit to automated testing, packaging, and deployment to my
        server, everything happens seamlessly through CI/CD. This page is the live
        result of that workflow.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is only the beginning. More advanced pipelines, containerized deployments,
        infrastructure automation, and cloud-native engineering coming soon.
      </p>
